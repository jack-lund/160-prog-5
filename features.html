        <h2>Documentation and How to Use</h2>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>For our final project, we made a program that creates a 3D scene using Three.js and allows the user to create and manipulate control points for a piecewise cubic Bezier curve.</li>
                <li>The scene includes a 3D model (Dora the Explorer) that moves along the curve. Users can add and move control points using GUI controls provided by the dat.gui library.</li>
                <li>Other settings are also available in the GUI like # of doras and the speed of the animation.</li>
                <br>
                <li>Dora is animated along the specifed Bezier Curve. This is done by having a t value go from 0 -> 1 and having an offset,</li>
                <li>Where each Dora is given an initial t value so they are equally spread across t = 0 to t = 1.</li>
                <li>Similarly each Bezier Curve that is used is alloted an equal amount of space across t.</li>
                <li>This means that if we have 3 curves, the first curve would be from t = 0 to t = 1/3, second curve would go from 1/3 to 1/6 and so on.</li>
                <li>If you enable the connect to start option in the GUI a curve will be draw from the end of your specifed line to the starting position.</li>
                <br>
                <li>The 2 points on the Bezier Curve p1 and p2, that the line does not intercept, are colinear to the next points.</li>
                <li>Example:</li>
                <li>Curve1: p0, p1, p2, p3</li>
                <li>Curve2: p4, p5, p6, p7</li>
                <li>Points p2 and p5 are colinear. When entering points this is done automaticaly where p0 and p1 for a new curve are already generated where p0 is the last point and p1 is colinear to the point before.</li>
                <br>
                <li>You can toggle on and off the points and lines, the lines draw the convex hull (I think that is what it is called) for each Bezier curve in the GUI.</li>
                <br>
                <li>You can also select a point (it will turn red) with a left click and then you can use the position buttons in the GUI for +x -x etc.</li>
                <li>This will make some points non-colinear if you change them.</li>
                <br>
                <li>The program also allows for the user to send Dora on 'an adventure'.</li>
                <br>
                <li>The 2 scences that are present are Heller Drive at UCSC and Space!</li>
                <li>Heller Drive is simply 6 screenshots from google street view and it turned out quite well, they are set as the background images to make it look like you are standing there.</li>
                <li>In Heller Drive there is also a table model that dora navigates around!</li>
                <br>
                <li>In Space, we have starts orbiting around Earth because everyone knows the earth is the center of the universe!</li>
                <li>The background is a static image, but stars are randomly generated around.</li>
                <li>There is an animation that moves the camera around automaticaly (hold right click and drag to change vantage points).</li>
                <li>The earth in the middle isn't just a normal sphere it uses a bump map and displacement map to cause elevation on the continents.</li>
                <br>
                <li>On Left click if enabled in the GUI you can spawn a Moon in space, this moon will also rotate around the earth. </li>
                <li>The moons are placed on the normal plane between the camera and mouse upon clicking. </li>
                <br>
            </ul>

        <h2>OP-ED</h2>
        <p>
            Dale Spence: I personally found this final project to be pretty enjoyable. I had a good time learning how to use the Three.js library and seeing class concepts come to life in a more intuitive fashion.
            I think it would have been cool if we could have worked with this library sooner, but I understand that time restraints make it difficult. 
        </p>

            Jack Lund: I had a great time messing around with Three.js. The thing I liked the most was the fact I didn't have to worry about buffers or attributes or the GLSL language.
            I was instead able to spend alot mroe time messing around with different Three.js features. I still did spend way too much time on the Bezier curves and trying to get all the feautres implemented I wanted around them.
            Much prefered this over WebGL but they are both pretty cool. One thing I couldn't figure out how to do was take a sphere and color is half 1 color and half another which I know how to do in WebGL (it is probably possible, just I couldn't figure it out.)
